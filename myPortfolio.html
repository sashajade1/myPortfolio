<h4>My Targets and What Progress I Am Making Towards It</h4>
  <div id="targets"><p contenteditable="false">One of my targets in life is to get into a career that i 
        enjoy doing and am generally interested in.<br> 
        The progress im making towards it has already started by teaching myself some coding,
    and now <br>having the oppurtunity to do a 12 Week Master Course with <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"><strong>CodeNation.</strong></a><br>
Another one of my targets is to improve my problem solving skills, im working towards this by making<br> sure
 when i have a problem to solve i break it down first and find multiple solutions, then i will go through <br>each solution to 
 get a better understanding of what im looking at, and pick the best one for me.

<div id="joinCodeNation"><h4>What Made Me Want To Join CodeNation</h4>
<p contenteditable="true">I wanted to join <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"></a>CodeNation</a> because i wanted to be able to work with other people with the same interest<br>
in coding as me and from CodeNations social sites this looked like the perfect place to be able to meet and <br>work with
others in this industry.<br> Another reason is when i first found out about CodeNation and heard
how much goes into the courses and<br> had a look round the website i didnt see me finding anything better to get my foot in the door.<br>
I think CodeNation also was the most inclusive for people who have just started out because i had previously<br> done some self taught
 web development & JavaScript but not to much and i didnt think i would be able to <br>find a course like this with my experience. </p>
